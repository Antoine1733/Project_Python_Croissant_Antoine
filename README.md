# Project_Python_Croissant_Antoine
The aim is to predict from 4 spectral images of a terrain, the type of terrain.
We are going to use several models to predict the test data given.(Logistic Regression, KNeigborsClassifier, GradientBoostingLCassifier, RandomForest)
The best model is therefore random forest, which has an accuracy of 0.91 on the test data.

Note :To use my API, you will need to run python app.py in anaconda prompt in the right folder.
